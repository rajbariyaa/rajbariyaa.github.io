what_i_learned: |
  Today began with me making a few small but important adjustments to our code to ensure everything was functioning smoothly. Once that was taken care of, our team shifted focus toward preparing for tomorrow's big presentation. One of the major tasks for the day was recording our demo video, where we explained how our entire project works—from data preprocessing and model training to the final predictions. It was a great way to practice communicating the technical details of our work in a way that's understandable to a wider audience.
  We are also planning to record a full presentation demo, which we will send to our faculty mentor, Dr. Kofi, for review. His feedback will be valuable in helping us polish our final delivery and catch any areas that may need improvement. On the technical side, I also dedicated some time to refining our Random Forest regression model. I’m tweaking hyperparameters and exploring feature importance to improve the model’s accuracy and generalizability. It’s rewarding to see our work come together both from a technical and presentational standpoint..

  No blockers so far for today. Everything is running smoothly and going as planned.
reflection: |
  As we approach our presentation day, I find myself feeling both excited and a little nervous. This will be my first time presenting in front of a large audience, and I really want to make a strong impression. Thankfully, I feel well-prepared, and so does my team. We've practiced, we understand our material inside and out, and we’re proud of what we’ve built.
  That said, I know that this is just one milestone in our journey. After the presentation, we have more ambitious goals lined up. One of the key next steps is diving into Explainable AI (XAI) to make our models more transparent and interpretable. It's something I’m genuinely looking forward to, as it adds a whole new layer of impact and trust to our work
