what_i_learned: |
  Abiola is in conference today as well but we did have a short meeting early in the morning. She advised us to do some task like practice Time Series and more. After completing it and getting my certificates, I decided to work on flight data that we collected. I did data cleaning on them and exported them to CSV file. I sampled a small portion of the cleaned dataset to perfom XGBoost and LSTM on them to make a ML model. I did it as a practice so that we all can start working on making a model from tomorrow.
blockers: |
  I dont have any major blockers except the fact that my computer struggles sometimes when working with huge dataset.
reflection: |
  I performed data cleaning on the dataset and exported the cleaned version into a CSV file. To prepare for model development, I took a small sample of the cleaned data and practiced building machine learning models using both XGBoost and LSTM. This exercise helped me better understand the modeling process and gave me practical experience in handling real data.

  The goal of today's work was to lay the groundwork so that the whole team can begin building and refining the model collaboratively starting tomorrow. Overall, it was a productive day of both learning and application.
