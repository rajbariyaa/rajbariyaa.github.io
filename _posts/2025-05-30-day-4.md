what_i_learned: |
  Today the day started with some file handling. We solved more complex problems using sets, dictionaries and file handling than yesterday. Later we had a brief about LLMs, tokenization and AI. We also had kahoot time where our knowledge was tested and also played bot or not.
blockers: |
  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  Getting knowledge about LLMs and knowing how it worked was quite intereseting. Knowing that AI can make music instantly and tbh the song's lyrics were very fun. Overall the session was proactive.
