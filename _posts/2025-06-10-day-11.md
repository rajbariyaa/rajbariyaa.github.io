what_i_learned: |
  Abiola is not here till Friday but we still have regular zoom meeting. She assigns us some tasks. She told us to watch some videos regarding data cleaning, EDA and making a machine learning model. I completed all the videos and did some practice on some sample data from kaggle. I have had no problems so far. I feel ready to work on real datasets from which we will be making our model. Today, I am working on to improve more on my ML algorithm development skills. After completing all the tasks Abiola gave us, I tried working with NOAA API to get climate dta. I am still having some trouble in it and will still work on it after I get home.

  I am unable to get weather data using API

  The videos Abiola gave us really helped me improve more of my skills in ML/AI. I also helped my team members in which they were having issues on. Practicing on raw data to improve more of my skills and I am also working on developing more of my ML algo development skills. I do feek that all my team members are ready to work on real datasets. I made a program to get weather past weather of a specific location but I am having some issues on it. Need to work on it.
