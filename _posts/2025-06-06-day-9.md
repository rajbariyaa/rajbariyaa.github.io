what_i_learned: |
  Today we made a slide showcasing our goals and progress of the team so far for the weekly assignment. Then we made a presentation video for the slide. Later Abiola gave us task to do some research on data merging and EDA. Then we shared what we learned from our research.
  She also gave us a task to find some datasets online and try merging them using the knowledge we gained from the research earlier. 
blockers: |
 There was not much of a blocker but I did find it a bit difficult to use seaborn library.

reflection: |
  We achieved a lot today since we worked together to put together a presentation highlighting our goals and what we have finished this week. Making the slide reminded us of our progress and what we still want to reach in the future.
  Later on, Abiola asked us to do a research  involving merging data and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). In this process, we gained some knowledge on it. We also had to find datasets online and mix them using the techniques we had been taught which helped us understand better.
  Even though there werenâ€™t many blockers, I did meet some difficulties while handling the Seaborn library. Need more practice on it.
