  Today we encountered a issues with streamlit, so we decided to move to flask. I changed the code from streamlit to flask which was completed easily. I also edited the CSS to make the UI of the website better. There seems to be no trouble while hosting it locally. I will try to host in using a thrid party site to see if there is any issues or not. As Wisdom and I were the only two to be present in lab today, we started working on our weekly presentation and made a weekly progress video as well.

  We had issues with streamlit about its link and it frequently going to sleep if being inactive for long time.
  
reflection: |
  I definitely got more hang of using HTML, CSS, and JS today as I have been working on it lately. Switching from Streamlit to Flask gave me a better understanding of how frontend and backend interact in a web app. It also helped me practice structuring Flask routes, templates, and static files properly. Editing the CSS to improve the UI gave me more confidence in styling and layout design. Overall, today was a productive day in terms of improving both my frontend and backend web development skills. I also realized how important it is to choose the right framework for deployment and performance needs.
