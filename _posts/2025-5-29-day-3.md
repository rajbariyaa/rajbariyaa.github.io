what_i_learned: |
  Today we started the day by learning how to train a model. We used teachable machines where we trained our model using images. Later we continued our pyhton102 classes where we practiced sets and dictionaries. We also had time bonding with our team members by playing escape rooms.
blockers: |
  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  I found it pretty fun that we can train a model that easily using some pictures only. The model was quite accurate. The team bonding activity was quite fun. The guys knows what we did, lol. The revision for set and dictionary was fruitful as well.
