what_i_learned: |
  Like yesterday, we also continued to find more research paper. Our team looked up a total of 66 papers that will help us for our research. While doing the research, I got to learn different AI terms like "HABA-MABA-AABA". I investigated machine learning applications in aviation research, for example, Regression Trees, XGBoost and Support Vector Machines (SVM) and realized how these models help in flight delay prediction as well as safety issues affecting airplanes.

  I learned about the ways AI assists in teaching aviation, prepares for flight and improves processes in running flights. I looked to see if any of the articles included information on flight delays fits with our objectives. We named our group "The FLYERS!". After completing the literature review, we had a small presentation showcasing our key findings, methodology and gaps in the research finding to other researchers.

reflection: |
  Today we focused on getting more confident with literature. I am very enthusiastic about proceeding to the model building stage, since the literature review part is almost finished. Our team has examined 66 papers so far, showing various aspects of Regression Trees, XGBoost and terms like HABA-MABA-AABA. Talking about these topics improved our understanding of both AI terminology and applications. We are now better at using Zotero to manage our references and make sure each of our references follows the IEEE format. The term "HABA-MABA-AABA", I find it quite interesting and will definitely do some more research on it. Can't wait to work on datasets and do some programming.
