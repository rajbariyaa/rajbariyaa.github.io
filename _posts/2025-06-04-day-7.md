what_i_learned: |
  Like yesterday, we also continued to find more research paper. Our team looked up a total of 63 papers that will help us for our research. While doing the research, I got to learn different AI terms like "HABA-MABA-AABA". I also got to know how different ML features like Regression Tree, XGBoost and more. I got more confident using ZoTero.

 NO BLOCKERS

reflection: |
  Today was about getting confident in our literature. The literature is about to come to an end and I am more eager to work on datasets and build our very own model. Our team is more than ever confident on literature review and citation.
