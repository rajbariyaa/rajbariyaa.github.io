what_i_learned: |
  I was a late in the morning because of an accident. When I arrived, my team was working on a fun task for team building. The task was fun and we definitely got to know each other more. We were assigned the task to find project related papers. Later we went through the paper and did some review on it. I also got to meet with DEPA team members. We all introduced each other. We also had a small meeting with DEPA.

  I got in an accident this morning, so I kinda missed everything in the morning.

reflection: |
  The team building activity was fun and I wished I could be here a bit earlier. I also got to meet with DEPA team members and got to learn what the team is about. All the members from DEPA had a fun research topic. I really hope to be a member of DEPA.
