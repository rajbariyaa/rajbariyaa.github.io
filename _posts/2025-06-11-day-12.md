what_i_learned: |
  Abiola is not here until Friday, but we are still holding our regular Zoom meetings. She assigned us tasks focused on data cleaning, EDA, and building machine learning models. I’ve completed all the video tutorials she provided.While working through the EDA videos, I paid particular attention to how different visualizations and statistical summaries can reveal underlying patterns, trends, and anomalies in data. I experimented with techniques like correlation heatmaps, pair plots, boxplots, and distribution charts using Seaborn and Matplotlib. I also practiced handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling. These hands-on exercises helped solidify my understanding of how crucial EDA is in shaping the direction of the machine learning pipeline. I also tried working on different data visualization like geospatial heatmap and sankey chart. 

Overall, I feel confident in my progress and ready to start working with real datasets for our machine learning projects. I’m also focusing today on refining my model development skills and making my ML pipelines more efficient and adaptable.
