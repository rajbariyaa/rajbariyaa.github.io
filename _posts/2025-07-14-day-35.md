what_i_learned: |
  Today me and Brice worked on making bar charts, line charts and pie charts for out data to put on our dashboard. After completing the dahboard, we started working on our website. I made a web application for flight prediction and some visualization. We used streamlit to make the dashboard. I also added data export functionality so users can download analysis results for further examination. The prediction system uses gauge charts and interactive visualizations to present results in an intuitive way. The entire application analyzes historical flight data for the top 10 US airlines and provides delay predictions using an XGBoost machine learning model enhanced with weather integration.
blockers: |
  I had complexity around weather API key management, but I simplified this by moving the API key configuration to the backend, making the user experience much cleaner.
reflection: |
  The combination of historical data analysis with predictive capabilities creates a powerful tool that could genuinely help travelers make informed decisions. Working with Flask, Plotly, and machine learning integration gave me excellent experience in full-stack development, showing how data science and web development can be combined effectively. This kind of integrated approach between data analysis, visualization, and prediction will be essential for creating impactful data science applications.
