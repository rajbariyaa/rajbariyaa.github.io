what_i_learned: |
  Abiola was not here today but she did give us tasks to do. She gave us some videos reference that we can watch to learn or improve our EDA skills. She gave us a total of seven videos, all of them containing dat cleaning, ML and EDA. Me being a CS student have some knowledge on it. Watching all the videos became like a revision session for me of class COSC251. But I will like to revise more to improve more of my data science skills to help everyone in the team.

reflection: |
  Abiola shared a total of seven  videos focused on data cleaning, machine learning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). These videos served as an excellent opportunity to deepen our understanding and enhance our skills in data science.

As a computer science student, I already had some familiarity with the topics, especially from my COSC251 class. Watching the videos felt like a helpful revision session, reinforcing concepts I had learned previously. However, I also realized that there is always room for improvement. I am motivated to revisit and strengthen these areas further so I can better contribute to the teamâ€™s progress and success. Developing strong EDA and data handling skills will not only benefit our current research work but also prepare me for future data-driven projects. I personally think that I am ready to work on flight and weather dataset for EDA puproses.
