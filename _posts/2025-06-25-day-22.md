  Like yesterday, I was still working on our huge dataset, I would say 60% of data will be completed by today and hopefully it will be completed by tomorrow. While my team members were working on data, I started making preparation for our presentation slides. The time for today at the lab is almost done but I will still be working on these data from  home and looking to finish it soon. We also had a fun team building activity hosted by Kyle. It was a fun experience. At first, I had to write instructions without using keywords and Brice had to draw it. And he did. Later I was teamed with Abiola. She gave me clear instructions but I couldn't figure it out. But it was very entertaining and think it helped to freshen our mood. The game really helped us improve our listening and communication skills.

  The only blocker is that our dataset is huge and is holding up making our AI model but we did test it up using smaller data and its showing about 83% accuracy.

  Today, I made good progress on our dataset—about 60% will be done, and I’m hoping to finish the rest by tomorrow. I also began working on our presentation slides while the team continued model development. We had a fun team-building activity led by Kyle, which helped lift our mood. I partnered with Brice and Abiola during the game, and it was both challenging and entertaining. Our main challenge is the large dataset, which is slowing down our AI model development. Still, initial tests on smaller samples show about 83% accuracy, which is positive thing to take on.
