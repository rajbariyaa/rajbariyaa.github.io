reflection: |
  We started the day with introduction. Our program co-ordinator told us about our programs. I also gave a placement test to test my pyhton knowledge. All of my fellow friends also played Bingo to get to know each other. It was exciting to learn Git and Github and to know how useful the application is. The session went well ending with a Jeopardy games to revise what I learned. At the end I would say the first day was very fruitful and cant wait to start again tomorrow.
