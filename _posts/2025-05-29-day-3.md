what_i_learned: |
  The day started with continiuing where we left yesterday. We continued making our website, learning to make changes to our About me section and blog post. Based on the placement test taken yesterday, we were seperated into groups. I was in Python102 and I was taught list, sets and dictionary. It felt like a good revision session.

 NO BLOCKERS

reflection: |
  The day was filled with fun activities. It felt productive to learn some basic python like a revision. Overall the day was quite good and the ending was fun as well ending with a game.
