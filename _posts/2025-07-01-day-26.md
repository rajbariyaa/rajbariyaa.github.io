what_i_learned: |
  Today Brice and me brought all our model together. We shared our code and put all our models like XGBoost, Random forest in a same file so it will be easier. Then we learned how we can explain our model. We also had time series graph and learn to  interpret it. After that we started working on our slides for the presenatation. All the slides are almost done. 
blockers: |
  There is no major blockers except to make a tiny fix on our XGBoost to avoid crashing.
reflection: |
  Today was a productive day of collaboration and integration. We focused on combining multiple components of our project into a unified structure, which significantly improved its organization and readability. A key part of our progress involved enhancing our understanding of model interpretability, allowing us to better communicate the results and logic behind our predictions. Additionally, we explored visual analytics, particularly through time series graphs, which offered new insights into trends within our dataset. Toward the end, we shifted our attention to preparing for the upcoming presentation, making substantial progress on the visual and content aspects of our slides. Overall, the project is moving smoothly with only a few minor adjustments left to polish.
