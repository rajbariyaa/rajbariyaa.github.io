what_i_learned: |
  Today's research paper writing workshop was incredibly valuable for understanding the structure and methodology behind academic publications. The session emphasized the importance of crafting compelling abstracts that effectively summarize methodology, findings, and implications. I learned how to structure literature reviews to build strong foundations for research questions, and discovered best practices for presenting data and visualizations in academic contexts. The workshop also highlighted the iterative nature of research writing, showing how papers evolve from initial drafts through peer review incorporation. The Kahoot quiz helped reinforce these concepts and highlighted areas where I need to strengthen my understanding of academic writing conventions. On the technical side, working on the geospatial heat map taught me more about optimizing visualization performance and improving data representation clarity.

  I initially struggled with data processing efficiency for the heat map, as large datasets were causing rendering delays. I also need to better understand which visualization techniques work best for different types of geospatial delay data.
  
reflection: | 
  Today highlighted the interconnected nature of research and technical development. The paper writing workshop reinforced how important clear communication is - not just in academic writing, but also in presenting technical work like the geospatial heat map.
The improvements I made to the delay visualization feel more meaningful now that I understand how to properly document and communicate the methodology behind them. The workshop emphasized that good research isn't just about finding insights, but about presenting them in a way that others can understand and build upon. Preparing for Dr. Kofi's presentation made me think critically about what aspects of our work are most important to highlight. It's exciting to see how the various components of our project are coming together into something cohesive and presentable. Looking forward to applying today's writing lessons to document our technical progress more effectively and to continue refining the heat map visualization based on what we've learned about effective data presentation.
