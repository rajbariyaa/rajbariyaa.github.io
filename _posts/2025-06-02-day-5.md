what_i_learned: |
  I was a late in the morning because of an accident. When I arrived, my team was working on a fun task called marshmallow game for team building. The task was fun and we definitely got to know each other more. We were assigned the task to find project related papers. I was assigned to look for papers related to "AI in Aviation". I looked them up in our Earl S. Richardson Library database and uploaded them to our common google drive so each member can have a look at it. I also got to meet with DEPA team members. We all introduced each other. We also had a small meeting with DEPA.

  I got in an accident this morning, so I kinda missed everything in the morning.

reflection: |
  The team building activity was fun and I wished I could be here a bit earlier. I also got to meet with DEPA team members and got to learn what the team is about. All the members from DEPA had a fun research topic. I really hope to be a member of DEPA.
