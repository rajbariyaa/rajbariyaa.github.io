  Today in the morning, we had a small meeting with Abiola to decide what we will be doing throughout the day. We did some revision on  Time Series and SQL. Later, Opeyemi and our team played kahoot to test our skills but we couldn't finish it due to internet issues. But she did give us some insights on CNN, KNN, XGBoost and LSTM. After meeting with Opeyemi, we started working on datastes. We had a small meeting on which data are required for our model and we are waiting for Abiola to accept out initial data selection.

  We found out one of our datasets is incomplete to so we had to find some new datasets. We found another dataset and combined we have about 6M data to work with.

  Today was a productive and collaborative day. We started with a morning meeting with Abiola, where we outlined our tasks and goals for the day. This helped set a clear direction and kept everyone aligned. We spent some time revising key concepts in Time Series and SQL, which was a helpful refresher. In the afternoon, we shifted focus to working with datasets. We had a short meeting to discuss which data would be essential for our model, and we’re currently waiting for Abiola’s feedback on our initial selection. During this process, we discovered that one of our datasets was incomplete, which posed a challenge. However, we were able to find a replacement dataset and now have approximately 6 million data points to work with, which puts us in a strong position moving forward.
