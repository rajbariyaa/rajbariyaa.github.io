  bio: |
    I’m currently a junior studying Computer Science at Morgan State University in Baltimore, MD. I expect to graduate in 2026.

    My work explores AI-Driven Flight Delay Prediction Model for Climate-Resiliant Airspace Management.

    When I’m not working on research, I enjoy playing soccer or reading some documentation.
