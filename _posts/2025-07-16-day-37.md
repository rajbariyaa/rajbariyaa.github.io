what_i_learned: |
  Today, I connected the prediction dashboard to our website, which felt like an milestone as it brought the analytical features to a live environment. After that, I began working on developing a geospatial heat map to visualize delays at various airports. This involved exploring how to represent delay data effectively in a spatial format, which is both a new and interesting challenge. Later in the day, we participated in a team-building activity focused on improving body language, which was a fun and valuable experience for strengthening communication within the team.
blockers: |
  There were no major blockers today, but I still need to finalize the data pipeline to ensure the heat map renders accurate and up-to-date information. I also plan to test the dashboard across different screen sizes and browsers to ensure consistent performance and appearance.
reflection: |
  Seeing the prediction dashboard live on the website was a rewarding moment and a clear sign of progress. The geospatial heat map project has introduced new technical challenges, but I'm enthusiastic about the learning opportunity. The team-building session was a great way to break up the day and helped foster better communication dynamics within the group. All that left on the dashboard is the visuals which we will be completing today and start writing our paper from the workshop we have tomorrow
