what_i_learned: |
  Our group carried on making an effort to gather new papers that could strengthen our literature review. I found relevant pieces of research and academic articles by using the Morgan Library Database which gave me entry to credible scholarly resources. This helped me improve at finding sources that fit our research aims. I also found out how to rightly cite our sources using the IEEE style of referencing which is necessary for academic honesty. Learning Zotero was very important, as it helps store all my research, manage every citation easily and colaboarte with our team members.

  Today was a productive day as our team focused on searching more research related to information. I also learned the IEEE citation which is very necessary for any papers to avoid plagiarism. Getting to know about ZoTero was very helpful as it is going to make our research journey very easy by organizing and citing. Today’s experience has helped me grow more confident in conducting academic research and collaborating efficiently with my team.
