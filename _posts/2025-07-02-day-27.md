what_i_learned: |
  Today at the start of the day, I had to make some tiny adjustmnets to our code. After that we started getting ready for our presenatation tomorrow. We recorded our demo video and explained how our code is working. Then we will also record a presentation demo, so that our Faculty mentor Dr. Kofi can have a look and give us feedback on our presenatation. I will also work on Random Forest regression model and tweak it a little to get more accuracy.
blockers: |
  No blockers so far for today. Everything is running smoothly and going as planned.
reflection: |
  I am very excited and nervous for our presenatation tomorrow. It will be my first time presenting infront of large crowd. I am well prepared and so is my team. After our presentation, we still need a long way to go. Our next goal is XAi. Thank you.
