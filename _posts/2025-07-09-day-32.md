what_i_learned: |
  Today, I spend the day optimizing the model. I worked on optimizing the hybrid model. After completing that, I started helping my team members with the dashboard. We together made a web application for our model. We checked to see which one is better among streamlit and Plotly dash. We tried sytling it using CSS and HTML. I am also trying to implement React to make it more interactive. Later, we had team building activity with Kyle. It was fun and we got to know different side of everyone. It was good to end the day with fun activity.

  As I am not so good with styling a web application, I was stuck for a bit but together we worked it out.
reflection: |
  Today was a productive and collaborative day filled with both technical progress and team bonding. I focused on optimizing our hybrid model, aiming to improve its performance and ensure it integrates well into our project pipeline. Ending the day with a team-building activity with Kyle was refreshing. It allowed us to relax, connect on a personal level, and see different sides of each other outside the technical environment.
