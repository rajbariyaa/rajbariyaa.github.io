  Today, all the interns and graduate mentors met at auditorium where we had a workshop with Anita Pandey. In today's workshop she gave us information about how to write introduction, problem title and how to write a catchy title to attract readers. This workshop was very helpful as we will start writing on our report soon. After the session, we had lunch break. After that, our team had a meeting with Abiola and all of us reported what we did this week. As we were on track with schedule, she gave us task. For me, I have to use future weather to predict the flight delay and I am still working on it. Soon we will have meeting with Dr. Kofi.

reflection: |
  Todayâ€™s workshop with Anita Pandey was insightful and focused on crafting effective introductions and catchy problem titles for our reports. I found it particularly helpful as we are preparing to start writing soon. Later, our team met with Abiola to share our weekly progress, and I was assigned the task of using future weather data to predict flight delays.
