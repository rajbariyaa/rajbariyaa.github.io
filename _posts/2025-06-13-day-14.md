what_i_learned: |
  I was present in the morning but couldn't continue throughout the day. So I went home but I was in contact with the team. Today we made a weekly video stating our accomplishments, problems and goals. Then Abiola gave us some courses on kaggle for us to continue where we could get certified like SQL, Time series and more. I have been doing the tutorials throughout the day.

  I am not feeling well today so it is being hard for me to focus.
reflection: |
  Today was a bit challenging as I wasn't feeling well, which affected my ability to stay focused and fully participate on-site. Despite that, I stayed in touch with the team remotely and ensured I remained engaged with our ongoing tasks. We created a weekly video highlighting our accomplishments, challenges, and upcoming goalsâ€”this helped us reflect on our progress and plan ahead. Additionally, Abiola introduced us to several valuable Kaggle courses like SQL and Time Series, which offer certifications. I spent the rest of the day working through these tutorials at my own pace.
