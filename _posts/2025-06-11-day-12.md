what_i_learned: |
  Abiola is not here until Friday, but we are still holding our regular Zoom meetings. She assigned us tasks focused on data cleaning, EDA, and building machine learning models. I’ve completed all the video tutorials she provided.While working through the EDA videos, I gave special attention to how different visualizations and statistical results can reveal underlying patterns, trends, and anomalies in data. I experimented with techniques like correlation heatmaps, scatter plots, boxplots, and distribution charts using Seaborn and Matplotlib. I also practiced handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling.I also tried working on different data visualization like geospatial heatmap and sankey chart. 

  Overall, I feel confident in my progress and ready to start working with real datasets for our machine learning projects. I’m also focusing today on refining my model development skills and making my ML pipelines more efficient and adaptable.

  Overall, I feel confident in my progress and ready to start working with real datasets for our machine learning projects. I’m also focusing today on how I can use geospatial heatmap to show which airports has the most delay in the US map. I also tried using sankey chart and need to work on it. I feel these data visualizations will help us present our project better to public. Looking forward to make our project better and help my team grow better and myself.
