what_i_learned: |
  Today has been ups and downs, mainly downs. We encountered with some problems. We used some new data. We took data from Jan and Feb 2025. All of our computers were not able to run the program due to large number of API calls of previously used 8M data. We had a small meeting with Dr. Kofi. He gave us a solution on how to batch the data together and do API call on weather of the particular place in time range instead of calling it repeatedly.

  We couldn't reach our daily goal today because we had a major issue. We couldn't enforce weather data together because we had a huge data. To tackle the problem, we decided to go for smaller data together but we still have around 1M data. As per the help we got from Dr. Kofi, we got a solution to group airport time range to get weather information fast instead of calling API everytime. I need to fix some API code and I am still working on it.
reflection: |
  Today was a challenging day, but it brought valuable lessons. Working with a new dataset from January and February 2025 exposed a major limitation in our current approach specifically, the inefficiency of making individual API calls for a large volume of data. The meeting with Dr. Kofi was especially insightful. His suggestion to batch API requests by airport and time range rather than making repetitive individual calls offered a more efficient and practical solution.
