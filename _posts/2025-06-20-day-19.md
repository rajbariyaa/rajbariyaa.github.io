what_i_learned: |
  We were working on data cleaning and merging and done with it. Abiola is back. We showed her our progress so far. We did some feature engineering as well. I showed her my weather API. I started integrating it to our dataset. Brice and I also taught Kyle how to make a github website. We also made our weekly videos today showing our progress and challenges. 
blockers: |
  I still have the same blocker. As we have a large dataset, and we are using an API to integrate weather information, my computer is lagging because of large data and also because of slow internet here, the request is being timeout. I will need to make some changes in the code for timeout.
reflection: |
  Today has been productive as well. We showed our progresss to Abiola. I still need to implement the weather data and I am working on it. The successful completion of data cleaning and feature engineering positions the team well for the next phase of analysis. The slow internet connection is creating timeout issues during API requests, while the substantial data volume is causing system lag. This bottleneck is affecting productivity and requires immediate attention to maintain project momentum.
