what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned the importance of clear communication and confidence during presentations as we practiced for our mid-summer check-in. It gave me a better understanding of how to present our technical work in a structured and engaging way. I also learned more about the data integration process and how to streamline large datasets efficiently. We managed to complete about 90% of the integration today. As soon as the data is fully integrated, I will start working on the AI model and move forward with the rest of the project components. This phase feels like a turning point where everything is finally starting to come together.

    No blockers today for me as everything is going as planned.
  reflection: |
  Today, we focused on practicing for our mid-summer presentation, which helped us gain more confidence in presenting our work clearly. We also made significant progress on our data integration task—about 90% of the data is now integrated. The project is coming together well, and we’re close to wrapping up this phase. It felt productive and encouraging to see everything aligning as we prepare for the next steps.
