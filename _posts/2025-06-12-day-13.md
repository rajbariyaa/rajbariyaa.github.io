what_i_learned: |
  Today all the interns met at Business building. We were divided to two teams where we competed against each other for team bonding. The winners could either go home early or arive late by an hour. Group 2 won the taboo game while we, group 1 won Zenga. Overall, it was nice to bond with each other. We were also taught to use overleaf for paper writing by Michael. After the lunch break, I did some practice in developing an AI model. Its not perfect yet but I could use it as practice to improve my skill more.
blockers: |
  No Blockers.
reflection: |
  The team bonding was fun. Looking at everyone, I think everyone had fun. The competition against the two groups were fun and entertainig. Model Development skill needs to be practiced more. Overleaf is a very handy tool. If I had known it earlier, I would have used it for my English101 and 102 for paper writing. Looking up for tomorrow where I can finally get to work on real data.
