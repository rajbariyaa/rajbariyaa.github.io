what_i_learned: |
  Today early morning, we had cohort, so all the interns met at the business building. There, we took the MBTI and VARK tests. The MBTI was for understanding our personality types, while the VARK test helped us determine our preferred learning styles. These two tests will definitely be helpful during research, as they allow us to understand our strengths and identify areas we can improve or adapt in. After the cohort session, we returned to the lab where we focused on finalizing the dashboard and gave it some finishing touches. The only task remaining is connecting the prediction page to the website. We also had a photoshoot for our dashboard. Everything is falling into place and progressing well.

  No blockers today, everything is going as per schedule and without any issues.
reflection: |
  It was a productive day. Taking the MBTI and VARK tests gave me more insight into how I function and learn, which I think will help me approach research challenges more effectively. The dashboard is nearly complete, and it's exciting to see how far we've come as a team. I'm looking forward to wrapping it up and seeing the final product live
