what_i_learned: |
  Today after arriving to the lab, we all sat down and Abiola gave us review about our presenatation. Then she divided task among us. I am assigned to increase accuracy of the model. So far, our highest accuracy of the model is 89%. My goal is to get atleast above 93%. I did some research on it and decided to go two ways. One is hyperparameter tuning and other is hybrid model. Today I did some research on hyperparameter tuning and wrte code for it. As my computer couldn't handle it, I let my team member Brice run my code on his computer.
blockers: |
  The only blocker I had is that my computer is not able to run the code and we will see if any error occurs after running the code.
reflection: |
  Today was nice day at the lab. We got the review on our presentation and also divided some task. Hyperparameter tuning is new to me. I did learn it few weeks ago but it was my first time implementing it on an actual project. Everything seems to go as planned and we hope to build a dashboard by the end of the week.
