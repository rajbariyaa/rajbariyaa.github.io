what_i_learned: |
  Today's research paper writing workshop was incredibly valuable for understanding the structure and methodology behind academic publications. The session emphasized the importance of crafting compelling abstracts that effectively summarize methodology, findings, and implications. I learned how to structure literature reviews to build strong foundations for research questions, and discovered best practices for presenting data and visualizations in academic contexts. The workshop also highlighted the iterative nature of research writing, showing how papers evolve from initial drafts through peer review incorporation. The Kahoot quiz helped reinforce these concepts and highlighted areas where I need to strengthen my understanding of academic writing conventions. On the technical side, working on the geospatial heat map taught me more about optimizing visualization performance and improving data representation clarity.

  I initially struggled with data processing efficiency for the heat map, as large datasets were causing rendering delays. I also need to better understand which visualization techniques work best for different types of geospatial delay data.
