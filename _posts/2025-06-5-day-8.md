what_i_learned: |
  Today all the groups gathered together in the business building. Then we had a college tour. I study here at Morgan. So I know the college but still felt nice going around the college. We started preparing for the presentation we have tomorrow. Later Abiola checked our python to determine our skills. We did some basic data loading, checking data types and checking if there is any empty data. We also had a brief meeting with Dr. Kofi to showcase what we did so far.

reflection: |
  The college tour was not new to me and in this heat, it was very tiring. Then, for me, divinding the tasks for presentation may help us improve our teamwork. Then we did some basic data loading features. I had learned it before but revising it was fruitful. Having a small brief presentation with Dr. Kofi was insightful. He cross-questioned us about some terms from our review and we got to know some for information.
