project_title: "AI-Driven Flight Delay Prediction Model for Climate-Resilient Airspace Management"

problem: |
  This project researches the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict weather-induced flight delays and improve climate resilience in airspace management. Using historical flight data, real-time weather reports, and air traffic information, students will develop AI-driven predictive models (Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTMs) to estimate potential disruptions. The project will also include a literature review on AI applications in aviation, feature engineering for improved model accuracy, and a visualization dashboard for real-time delay forecasting.
