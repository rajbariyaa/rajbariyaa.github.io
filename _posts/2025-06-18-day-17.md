what_i_learned: |
  We had a cohort today, where all the interns got together. Dr. Mack gave us information of the things she previously stated like paycheck, weekly videos and all. She also gave us information about the presentation we have next week. We also got to meet Kyle who is a high school teacher and also a part of our team. She will be helping us with project, team bonding, presentations and everything. After our lunch, we had a small tour with Kyle, where we showed her around DEPA lab. After that, our team locked in for the project. Wisdom and Tahia worked on dataset, Brice worked on how to train the ML model and what data are required and I developed a small program that will help us get climate information like humidity, precipitation, temperature and everything using OPENWEATHER API.

  Initially, I had a problem because a lot of APIs were expensive to retrieve historical data. After doing some more research, I found OPENWEATHER. It had all the required informations and was not that expensive as well.
reflection: |
  The cohort was fun today. We played a game called Titanic, where we had to list item based on priorities if we stranded in the water. We also had another icebreaker where we had to describe our project without telling our project name or keywords. Thats how we got to meet with Kyle. We also introduced ourselves to Kyle. I believe today might be the most productive day as we came progressed a lot for the project. We still have a long way to go. We have to start preparing for mid-program presentation as well.
