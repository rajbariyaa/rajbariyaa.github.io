what_i_learned: |
  Today morning, we all met at business building where Dr. Mack gave us a brief instruction about our mid summer presentation that we have this Friday. She also gave us information on paycheck. After our meeting with her, we all came back to our lab. Yesterday at home, I finished integrating weather informationa at home for the first two months of 2025. Using that data, my team members started making prediction model using CNN, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree. While they were making the model, I started working on our original dataset consisiting of 8M flight data. My program is still working on it. Hopefully it should be done by the end if day or tomorrow.
blockers: |
  Today we had no blockers except for the huge dataset being computed.
reflection: |
  We were lacking behind on our weekly goal because of large dataset. But our group worked extra hard and we are almost on track. We still to finish on the large dataset and I feel confident we can get it done on time. I will be working late today and I will still try to tweak the code and see if I can make the code any faster.
