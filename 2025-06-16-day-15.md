what_i_learned: |
  Abiola had a conference this week as well. But we did have a short meeting with her early in the morning. She advised us to complete our training. I completed my training and started working on the datasets we had. I did some data cleaning like removing unnnecessary columns, dropping null values and more. After cleaning those data, I browsed on how I can apply the ML model that we learned previously on my dataset. 
blockers: |
  So far, I have no major blockers except my computer struggling to process large datasets.
reflection: |
  Today has been very prodcutive for me. I did major data cleaning. I also got some certification from kaggle which I can post on LinkedIn. Like I mentioned earlier, my computer struggled to work with large dataset, so I initially sampled my dataset to make it smaller and did some XGBoost to practice my ML model developing skill.
